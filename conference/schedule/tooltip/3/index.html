<h3 style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px;">Keynote: Mark Pesce; &quot;How Not To Be Seen&quot;</h3><p><br/><span style="white-space: nowrap; padding-left: 1em; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">60min Plenary Session</span><br/><span style="white-space: nowrap; padding-left: 1em; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;">Saturday 09:15am, Ionic Room</span><div style="padding-left: 2em;">Although Mark Pesce does know Python, he doesn&#39;t consider himself any sort of expert so he won&#39;t be talking about Python, except to whinge that his friends pick on him for choosing a language which uses whitespace as syntax.  Try as he might, he can&#39;t get his friends to see the logic of this - even though they always pretty-print their own code, in whatever language they write.  Go figure.  So, Mark will not be talking about that. What will Mark be talking about?  Well, um, err...  (sound of shuffling papers) ...oh, yeah, here it is: &#39;Mark Pesce will be talking about stuff.  And things.  And how great it all is.  No, really.  You&#39;ll see.  Promise.&#39;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Mark is best-known as the co-inventor of VRML, and as panelist/judge on ABC&#39;s &quot;The New Inventors&quot;. The author of five books and numerous articles, he has a monthly column in NETT magazine, is a frequent contributor to ABC Unleashed, and is a sought-after commentator on both radio and television. Since 2006, Pesce has held an Honorary Appointment in the Digital Cultures Program at the University of Sydney.</div></p>
