SUMMARY:CodeWars
DESCRIPTION:Room: Atlassian HQ\nPresenters: \n120min Social Event\nOriginall
 y based on an idea from the book PeopleWare\, CodeWar has been run in conju
 nction with the Sydney WebDU conference since 2008 with great success. To h
 elp share the mayhem we're proud to bring CodeWar to PyCon-au 2010\, with e
 xperienced CodeWar compare Robin Hilliard from RocketBoots on the microphon
 e to keep a wry eye on proceedings.\n\nThe competition will consist of thre
 e rounds of differing programming challenges.\n\nWe guarantee this won't be
  mind twisting problems for algorithm heads and you can compete with whatev
 er language you want. It will help to have a team with a mix of skills\, a 
 clever and/or intimidating team name and vocal cheer squad. However the onl
 y thing your team must bring is a single laptop with a VGA connector runnin
 g in 1024x768 mirrored mode.\n

SUMMARY:Keynote: Mark Pesce; "How Not To Be Seen"
DESCRIPTION:Room: Ionic Room\nPresenters: \n60min Plenary Session\nAlthough 
 Mark Pesce does know Python\, he doesn't consider himself any sort of exper
 t so he won't be talking about Python\, except to whinge that his friends p
 ick on him for choosing a language which uses whitespace as syntax.  Try as
  he might\, he can't get his friends to see the logic of this - even though
  they always pretty-print their own code\, in whatever language they write.
   Go figure.  So\, Mark will not be talking about that. What will Mark be t
 alking about?  Well\, um\, err...  (sound of shuffling papers) ...oh\, yeah
 \, here it is: 'Mark Pesce will be talking about stuff.  And things.  And h
 ow great it all is.  No\, really.  You'll see.  Promise.'\n\nMark is best-k
 nown as the co-inventor of VRML\, and as panelist/judge on ABC's "The New I
 nventors". The author of five books and numerous articles\, he has a monthl
 y column in NETT magazine\, is a frequent contributor to ABC Unleashed\, an
 d is a sought-after commentator on both radio and television. Since 2006\, 
 Pesce has held an Honorary Appointment in the Digital Cultures Program at t
 he University of Sydney.

SUMMARY:Need for Speed
DESCRIPTION:Room: Tuscan Room\nPresenters: Dr. Graeme Cross\n30min Intermedi
 ate\ncategories: \n"Bottlenecks occur in surprising places\, so don't try t
 o second guess and put in a speed hack until you have proven that's where t
 he bottleneck is." (Rob Pike)\n\nPython is a great balance of productivity\
 , expressiveness and performance\, but there are times when it would nice t
 o have a Python application run faster. This is particularly true for large
  scale data processing\, numerical work\, controlling real world devices\, 
 and animation.\n\nUsing some real-world examples\, this talk covers tools a
 nd techniques that allow you to systematically understand where the bottlen
 ecks are in your code and then how to effectively optimise your code\, with
 out having to resort to writing modules in C/C++.

 hile attention is often paid to the headline techniques such as motion capt
 ure and complex physics simulation\, few realise that the majority of the w
 ork is underpinned by a foundation of Python.  This talk introduces the app
 lication of Python in the visual effects industry.

 n & The Quest for the Holy Grail\n\nLanguage interoperability is one of the
  Holy Grails of programming languages. Choose your language\, choose your f
 ramework and freely exchange objects and methods.\n\nIs this Anarcho-syndic
 alism of application architecture? Are the serfs in the fields of developme
 nt teams rebelling against the rightful King of the Realm?\n\nIs the Dynami
 c Language Runtime from Microsoft merely a French castle in the Kingdom of 
 England?\n\nHow does this all fit with the open source Knights of Ni that l
 urk in the thickest of forests?\n\nAnd the so-called Holy Hand Grenade of A
 ntioch\, Ruby\, really a weapon of mass destruction?\n\nFind out in Nick Ho
 dge's keynote.\n\nA Professional Geek at Microsoft in Australia\, Nick spen
 ds his time with open source communities showing off Microsoft open source 
 cool and shiny toys. Prior to Microsoft\, Nick spent many a weekend over 3 
 years building an internal sales management tool using Python\, Excel and S
 AP to counter-act the evilness of being a sales manager. Please do not ask 
 about these dark times in polite conversations. More info about Nick may or

SUMMARY:Genropy - a framework for creating complex applications deployed on 
 the web
DESCRIPTION:Room: Tuscan Room\nPresenters: Mr. Jeff B Edwards\n30min Interme
 diate\ncategories: \nGenropy is the python implementation of Genro\, and is
  an application framework quite different from the standard (django\, cherr
 ypy\, turbogears)\, for building powerful database applications deployed fr
 om the browser.  Many differences and advantages between this framework and
  traditional python application frameworks are explained. Genropy is a suit
 able for creating complex 'applications' as opposed to 'sites'. The differe
 ntiation is that an application is something an operator uses all day\, has
  trained users\, that have to 'squeeze' all the power from it available.  C
 onversely\, a 'site' is basically public and not necessarily powerful as a 
 user spends a relatively small amount of time on it. Genropy is the framewo
 rk for creation applications.  It is used for attendee registration and sal
 es in pycon italy\, the larger national conference in Europe (Florence\, It
 aly).  \nThis session will demonstrate how to create a simple application (
 3 tables) and demonstrate the ease and power of using python for the model 
 view and controller on the client.  It demonstrates how one api- being the 
 genro Bag - is used to create the model\, to map the sql to objects\, to cr
 eate the GUI and communicate all data. So all of it can be done in python i
 nstead of having to use many different technologies and languages.\nJeff Ed
 wards from Goodsoftware is strategic partner of Sofwell who is the author o
 f Genropy.

SUMMARY:Displaying Australian datasets with Django
DESCRIPTION:Room: Tuscan Room\nPresenters: Mr. Malcolm Tredinnick\n45min Int
 ermediate\ncategories: \nThe last 18 months or so in Australia have seen an
  increased number of government and public sector organisations releasing d
 atasets to the public under reasonable reuse terms (often Creative Commons 
 license). This talk will take a couple of those local real-world datasets a
 nd create a minimal website for remixing them\, using Django as the underly
 ing framework. The goals are to provide a short walk through the process of
  importing and extracting such data in practice\, show how to incorporate D
 jango's GIS features into an application\, as well as highlighting that rea
 l world is messy and so is the data it produces. Working with datasets for 
 journalism or research purposes\, or simply fun\, requires a certain attent
 ion to detail.\n\nBasic knowledge of Django is assumed\, although the GIS c
 omponents will be introduced carefully as they are less familiar to many de
 velopers.

SUMMARY:GLAMkit: a better\, faster\, stronger way to write reusable Django c
 ode
DESCRIPTION:Room: Tuscan Room\nPresenters: Dr. Greg Turner\n30min Intermedia
 te\ncategories: \nAs part of our web development work for Galleries\, Libra
 ries\, Archives and Museums (the so-called GLAM sector)\, we have open-sour
 ced the common tools and design patterns that we have developed as a web fr
 amework called GLAMkit (http://glamkit.org).\n\nGLAMkit is based on Django\
 , and is inspired by its design philosophy of several apps which implement 
 specific features. However\, by looking at the successes and challenges fac
 ed by other CMSes and collections of apps such as Pinax\, we have taken the
  philosophy a stage futher.\n\nRather than being a collection of Django app
 s\, we have constructed GLAMkit as a collection of optional and reusable Dj
 ango 'toolkits' for implementing common features. We leave the implementati
 on details - the things that Django already does brilliantly - to the appli
 cation developers themselves.\n\nIn this talk\, we will present the history
  of GLAMkit's development\, with particular focus on how our approach to re
 usability came about\, and some examples of that approach.

SUMMARY:Introducing Python to a Java shop
DESCRIPTION:Room: Ionic Room\nPresenters: Juergen Brendel\n30min Intermediat
 e\ncategories: \nThere is a time and place for everything: For some applica
 tions Python is perfect\, for others a language like Java and its entire ec
 osystem is more ideal. In this talk we see how Python was introduced to a J
 ava shop as a vehicle for rapid and dynamic prototyping of a new project. T
 he talk then explains how Jython/Java integration was used to translate thi
 s project step by step from Python to Java. Going beyond the advocacy focus
 \, the talk then shows the interfaces to call Java from Python and vice ver
 sa and illustrates those with examples. Furthermore\, unit testing of Java 
 classes via test cases written in Python is also touched upon.
